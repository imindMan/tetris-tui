# INTRODUCTION

Tetris-tui is a tetris-clone TUI program designed to give an (almost) ultimate experience of tetris in the TUI environment. Inspired hugely by [TETR.IO](https://tetr.io) and [Jstris](https://jstris.jezevec10.com)

This project is written mainly in Nim, it will support some features:

- Different gameplay modes: Classic, Sprint, Cheeseplay, Survival, Zen Mode, Custom maps, Challenges, etc.
- Preview for dropping, hard drop, soft drop, SRS, hold, 1-to-5 next-block preview, etc.
- Huge customization and configuration options, also some quick configuration inside the program itself.
- Music embedded (may depend on the OS)
- Leaderboard, now local but maybe global in the future.

This project is currently in development and testing. The alpha version will intend to have 3 first features. Contribution are welcomed.

***NOTE: THIS PROJECT DOESN'T INTEND TO BE ABSOLUTELY MATCHED THE TETRIS GUIDELINE. ONLY THE DEFAULT CONFIGURATION MATCHES IT.***
